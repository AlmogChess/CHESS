# CHESS

"Bullet or Blitz" tournament - each player has one to three minutes per turn. 
Besides moving the piece, it takes time to start the clock and write the move
in order to record all the moves that were in the game. It's also a non-modern game environment.
Our automatic chess board solves this problem and adds elegance to the game. 
The players concentrate on the game itself and not on clocks and writing moves.
All moves will be recorded in the form and sent to the mobile at the end of the game
(allowing the player to perform independent analysis or through an external feature).
In addition, it is not possible to make illegal moves (thus the board is a sort of judge).
Every move a player makes activates the opponent's clock, thus saving critical time in short games, 
and convenience in long games.
You can choose the time for each player.
